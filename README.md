# TIE-Net
TIE-Net structure code
* If you want to use our TIENet in the network, please add the structure of TIENet.py to the front of the network backone and keep the input and output channels consistent. For example, yolo's yaml file.
* Remember to adjust the size of the input image. It is 300 * 300 in SSD. Yolov5 can scale the image adaptively.
